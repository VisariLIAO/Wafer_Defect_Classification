# Project Overview

This project presents a wafer map defect classification system based on deep learning.It combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), and iteratively improves model performance from model1 to model11.

# Dataset

We use the Mixed-type Wafer Defect Dataset (MixedWM38), which contains 38,015 wafer maps of size 52×52 pixels. The dataset includes:

- arr_0: Wafer map data where  
  - 0 = blank spot  
  - 1 = normal die (passed electrical test)  
  - 2 = broken die (failed electrical test)  

- arr_1: One-hot encoded labels representing 8 basic defect types (single defects).
  1.Center
  2.Donut
  3.Edge-Loc
  4.Edge-Ring
  5.Loc
  6.Near-full
  7.Random
  8.Scratch

This is a multi-label classification task, as one wafer map can exhibit multiple defect types simultaneously.

### 💡 Motivation & Problem Statement 
Wafer defect detection is a critical step in semiconductor manufacturing to ensure product quality and reduce costs. Traditional inspection methods are often time-consuming and subject to human error. This project aims to develop an automated, accurate, and robust multi-label classification system to efficiently identify various defect types on wafer maps, helping manufacturers improve yield and minimize defective products.

晶圓缺陷檢測是半導體製造中確保產品品質與降低成本的重要環節。傳統檢測方法耗時且易受人為誤差影響。本專案旨在開發自動化且準確的多標籤分類系統，有效識別晶圓圖中的多種缺陷，協助提升良率並減少缺陷品。

### 🎯 Why Prioritize High Precision 
In wafer defect detection, **high precision** means predicted defects are very likely true defects, significantly reducing false positives. Excessive false positives lead to unnecessary rework and waste of resources. Therefore, prioritizing precision minimizes unnecessary inspections and interventions, improves production efficiency, and maintains product quality.

## Evaluation Metrics

This project addresses a multi-label classification problem where each wafer map may contain multiple defect types. Therefore, a single accuracy metric is insufficient to fully evaluate model performance. We use the following evaluation metrics:

- **Precision**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. Indicates the reliability of positive predictions and helps reduce false positives.

- **Recall**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all actual positives. Reflects the model’s ability to detect positive instances, reducing false negatives.

- **F1-score**: The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall, providing a balance between the two, commonly used in multi-label classification.

- **Sub-accuracy**: The average accuracy calculated per label, measuring the model’s stable performance across each defect type.

All metrics are computed per defect category and averaged (macro or micro averaging) to fairly assess the multi-label classification results.
