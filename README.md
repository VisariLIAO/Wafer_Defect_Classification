# Dataset

We use the Mixed-type Wafer Defect Dataset (MixedWM38), which contains 38,015 wafer maps of size 52×52 pixels. The dataset includes:

- arr_0: Wafer map data where  
  - 0 = blank spot  
  - 1 = normal die (passed electrical test)  
  - 2 = broken die (failed electrical test)  

- arr_1: One-hot encoded labels representing 8 basic defect types (single defects).
  1.Center
  2.Donut
  3.Edge-Loc
  4.Edge-Ring
  5.Loc
  6.Near-full
  7.Random
  8.Scratch

This is a multi-label classification task, as one wafer map can exhibit multiple defect types simultaneously.

# Problem Definition

- **Task**: Multi-label classification of wafer defects.  
- **Output layer**: 8 neurons with sigmoid activation function.  
- **Loss function**: Binary cross-entropy (`binary_crossentropy`).

### 💡 Motivation & Problem Statement 
Wafer defect detection is a critical step in semiconductor manufacturing to ensure product quality and reduce costs. Traditional inspection methods are often time-consuming and subject to human error. This project aims to develop an automated, accurate, and robust multi-label classification system to efficiently identify various defect types on wafer maps, helping manufacturers improve yield and minimize defective products.


---

### 🎯 Why Prioritize High Precision 
In wafer defect detection, **high precision** means predicted defects are very likely true defects, significantly reducing false positives. Excessive false positives lead to unnecessary rework and waste of resources. Therefore, prioritizing precision minimizes unnecessary inspections and interventions, improves production efficiency, and maintains product quality.



# Model Architecture


Hybrid Neural Network Model Architecture and Key Techniques
This project presents an innovative CNN and MLP dual-branch architecture, designed to effectively capture both spatial features and raw data patterns. It integrates various advanced techniques to enhance model performance and robustness.

🏗️ Model Architecture Overview
The model consists of two independent branches: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) branch and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) branch, with their outputs integrated through a fusion layer.

The model consists of two independent branches: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) branch and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) branch, with their outputs integrated through a fusion layer.

### 1. CNN Branch

Dedicated to capturing spatial features and local patterns within the data.

- **Structure:** Comprises 3 convolutional blocks with increasing filters:  
  - Block 1: 64 filters  
  - Block 2: 128 filters  
  - Block 3: 256 filters  
- **Inside each block:**  
  - BatchNormalization: Accelerates training and improves stability  
  - LeakyReLU Activation: Introduces non-linearity and prevents the "dying neuron" problem of ReLU  
  - MaxPooling2D: Downsamples and extracts dominant features  
- **Final Layer:** Dense layer with L2 regularization and Dropout to reduce overfitting

### 2. MLP Branch

Processes raw input data directly to learn low-dimensional or non-spatial patterns.

- **Structure:**  
  - Flatten input data  
  - Dense(512) fully connected layer  
  - Dense(256) fully connected layer  
- **Activation Function:** LeakyReLU for all dense layers

### 3. Fusion Layer

Integrates features extracted from both CNN and MLP branches for final decision making.

- **Operation:** Concatenate feature vectors from CNN and MLP branches  
- **Subsequent layers:**  
  - Dense(256) + Dropout  
  - Dense(8) output layer with Sigmoid activation for multi-label classification

## Evaluation Metrics

This project addresses a multi-label classification problem where each wafer map may contain multiple defect types. Therefore, a single accuracy metric is insufficient to fully evaluate model performance. We use the following evaluation metrics:

- **Precision**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. Indicates the reliability of positive predictions and helps reduce false positives.

- **Recall**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all actual positives. Reflects the model’s ability to detect positive instances, reducing false negatives.

- **F1-score**: The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall, providing a balance between the two, commonly used in multi-label classification.

- **Sub-accuracy**: The average accuracy calculated per label, measuring the model’s stable performance across each defect type.

All metrics are computed per defect category and averaged (macro or micro averaging) to fairly assess the multi-label classification results.


## 📈 Final Model Performance （model11）

| Metric index       |   Score    |

| Macro F1-score     | **0.9792** |
